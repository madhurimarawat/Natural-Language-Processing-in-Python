        "### Importing the Required Library\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import re\n",
        "```\n",
        "This line imports the `re` module, which stands for regular expressions, and will be used for working with regular expressions in the code.\n",

        "def generate_regex(text):\n",
        "    regex = re.escape(text)\n",
        "    regex = regex.replace(r'\\ ', r'\\s+')\n",
        "    return regex\n",
        "```\n",
        "This function, `generate_regex`, takes a text input and performs the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `re.escape(text)`: This function escapes special characters in the input text, ensuring that they are treated as literal characters in the regular expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `regex.replace(r'\\ ', r'\\s+')`: This line replaces escaped space characters (`\\ `) with `\\s+`, where `\\s` represents any whitespace character, and `+` means one or more occurrences. This modification allows for flexibility in matching multiple spaces in the input text.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The final regular expression is returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Main Section\n",

        "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",

        "    print(f'Generated Regular Expression is: {regex}')\n",
        "```\n",
        "The main section of the code initializes a sample text, calls the `generate_regex` function to create a regular expression based on the text, and then prints both the original text and the generated regular expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation\n",
        "The purpose of this code is to create a regular expression pattern that can be used to match the input text, considering the input text may contain special characters and multiple spaces. The function aims to make the text suitable for pattern matching in a way that accounts for potential variations in spacing. This code then demonstrates the usage of the function with a sample text."
